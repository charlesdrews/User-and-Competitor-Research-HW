\i\fs24 \cf0 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 1) If you are in an entirely new location, by yourself (no friends nearby) and you are hungry\'85 how do you find food?\
\
ANSWER: Research beforehand, talk to hotel people, just walk around and see what I am in the mood for, then google it or yelp it, and usually based on the way they look on the outside and check out the outdoors menu and price\cb1 \

\i\fs24 \cf0 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 2) How do you determine what TYPE of food do you want to eat?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \
ANSWER: \cf2 \cb3 Depends on my mood or location, if that place is known for a specific type of food or what that town is known for. The price is important too. I go to smaller restaurants if I\'92m by myself.\

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 3) How often do you try new restaurants? If you are new to an area, you are forced to try something new, what makes you choose one restaurant over another?\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 ANSWER: \cf2 \cb3 Maybe 2-3 times a week. I choose a restaurant based on type of food they are serving and price. Also accessibility, whether I need to travel far to get it or if it\'92s just next door.\cb1 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 1) If you are in an entirely new location, by yourself (no friends nearby) and you are hungry\'85 how do you find food?\
\
ANSWER: Google, I google everything. I usually look for the \'93top ten\'94 or \'93best\'94 in the city I\'92m in.\cb1 \

\i\fs24 \cf0 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 2) How do you determine what TYPE of food do you want to eat?\
\
ANSWER: I\'92m open to everything so whatever is on the list after I google is fine with me. But I do prefer more Asian type food like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, etc.\

\i\fs24 \cf0 \cb1 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 3) How often do you try new restaurants? If you are new to an area, you are forced to try something new, what makes you choose one restaurant over another?\
\
ANSWER: All the time! I love trying new food. If there are a bunch of new restaurants for me to try I would try them all. But if I had to pick which ones I go to first I usually default to Asian food before the others. Unless they have fresh seafood, that trumps Asian food. Unless it\'92s Asian seafood. Yum!\cb1 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 4) Are you open to trying exotic delicacies of the local area?\
\
ANSWER:  Of course! Oh wait, I don\'92t like live insects, that creeps me out.\cb1 \

\i\fs24 \cf0 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 5) If Yes, How did you discover the local delicacy?\
\
ANSWER: Usually referral from a friend who lives there or has been there before.\
\
Followup question: How did your friends know about the local delicacy?\
ANSWER: Well the ones that live there just know. I think the ones who just visit get recommendations from the local people. My friends are very friendly and would just start chatting with random people and they would recommend things to them when they find out they are from out of town.\cb1 \

\i\fs24 \cf0 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 6) How does cost factor in when you are deciding your restaurant choice? Vacation? Local? Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner?\
\
ANSWER: I know I have a small budget but when it comes to food I usually go all out. Especially when I am on vacation since I know I won\'92t get to eat those things when I come back. Breakfast, lunch or dinner doesn\'92t matter, if I want to eat it, I\'92ll pay for it.\
