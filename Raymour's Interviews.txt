\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0I once used Yelp but have found that their rating system is unreliable. I find that Yelpers think that they are actual food critics, and they write very profound reviews having only visited the restaurant only one time. A true food critic will visit a restaurant multiple time, in some cases as many as 10 times, aggregating a collection of experiences before advertising their judgment of a restaurant.\cb1 \

\i\fs24 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 I try new restaurants often, mostly deciding to actually go from a friend\'92s recommendation.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 For me, like most people, this is completely situational, I find myself choosing to actually go out and eat at a restaurant at least once a week and it usually is something that happens Thursday through Sunday.\

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 Same answer as the first question \'9336 Hours\'94\'85 I will normally read the article and then yelp/google the restaurants listed to make sure they are still in business.\cb1 \

\i0\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 It depends on if I am in a rush or not, as a medical professional I don\'92t have a ton of time to really splurge, so I use my time efficiently, so when I do go out, I take my restaurant choices very seriously.}
