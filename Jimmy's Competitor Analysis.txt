\f0\fs28 \cf0 App Features Comparison between Yelp, Zagat, and Google/Google Maps\
\
\

\b \ul YELP
\b0 \ulnone \
\
PROS:\
- Home screen shows nearby places for food that changes according to the time of day. (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner)\
- Yelp items even in condensed viewing format has option to Reserve or place an order for pickup or delivery from restaurants that offer it.\
- Navigation drawer has a cute animation of a dragon going down an elevator.\
- Activity screen shows most recent friend reviews.\
- Search bar has an extensive filter popup feature.\
- Map screen button on Search tab screen brings up Google map with all search results shown on the map by number as a pin. Ads were shown as a different pin.\
- On Google Map screen, clicking a button shows name of restaurant, number of reviews and rating, price rating, hours of operation, and a button to make a reservation, or order for take out or delivery.\
- Detail screen gives detailed options of the restaurant as well as user reviews and photos. Most notable option is the \'93Explore the menu\'94 option where applicable.\

\cf0 \
CONS:\
- Search screen shows 2 Promoted (aka ADs) at the top of the screen.\
- Everything is based on user reviews including pictures \
- Detail Screen can be very overwhelming when looking at it for the first time. Too much information, too little space.\
- No home button, every screen you visit is on the back stack, took 30 back presses to leave the app using the back button, forces you to either keep it active in the background or use recents button to close it immediately.\
\
\
\

\b \ul GOOGLE / GOOGLE MAPS
\b0 \ulnone \
\
PROS:\
- Shows your location and nearby restaurants from the get go.\
- Filter bar below search bar is a nice feature for quick filtering.\
- Clicking on a pin shows a lot of information without leaving the screen such as restaurant info, user reviews and ratings and pictures.\
- Button for 3D street view so you know when you found the right place.\
\
CONS:\
- Filter bar below search bar has very limited options.\
- Not sure how the filtering works but entering \'93Seafood\'94 displayed a lot of steakhouses. Even if a steakhouse offers seafood, someone searching for seafood probably only wants restaurants that specialize in seafood.\
- Very limited on what restaurants are shown.\
- Showing \'93Zagat rated\'94 as a filter option.\
- With \'93restaurant\'94 as the only search word, it did not show the dozens of restaurants within 2 blocks of where I lived. \
